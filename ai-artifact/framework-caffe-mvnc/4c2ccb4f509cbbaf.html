Pre-requisites:<br>

Note that Movidius Neural Compute Stick can run only on Raspbian
Stretch or above. You can download this image for your RPi 
<a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian">here</a>.

Since this OS version doesn't have integrated OpenCV support
in Python 3, you will need to answer "yes" to build OpenCV when
installing MVNC package. It will take a very long time
(sometimes more than an hour) but it may be worth it.
